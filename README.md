# lockers-app-backend
This Git repository contains the source code for the backend of a Locker application designed for secure package storage. The application is developed in JavaScript, making use of the following technologies:

Node.js: The JavaScript runtime platform that enables us to build a highly efficient and scalable server-side application.

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that we use to store and manage locker, package, and user information flexibly and scalably.

RESTful API: We have implemented a RESTful API that allows clients to interact with the application in a straightforward and consistent manner. The API provides endpoints for locker, package, and user management.
